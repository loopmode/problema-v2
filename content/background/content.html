    <h3>One bright day in the early 21st Century, there was a gathering of human beings unlike any before.</h3>

    <p>
        In the historic heart of Berlin, Germany, over 100 people from all walks of life and all round the world joined in a single circle. Seated together at the world's largest round table, they had come to speak on behalf of themselves and others, to rediscover how much they don't know and how much they do.

        <h3>THE GATHERING</h3>

            <p>On Saturday, September 9th, 2006, the Berlin square called 'the Bebelplatz' was spanned by a monolithic, architectural circle within circles, a vast round table at which 114 chairs faced 114 continuously recording cameras. Reflected within their collective lens, an unprecedented art event and political summit convened, a gathering dedicated to addressing 100 questions originally raised online by people on seven continents.</p>
            <p>Voicing the questions aloud before the assembly were the event's co-moderators, human rights advocate Hafsat Abiola and actor Willem Dafoe. Over a six-hour mind-marathon spread over a nine-hour day, each question received up to 112 responses given face to face, directly to camera, by the participants of the Table of Free Voices. Captured additionally by roving film cameras streaming live online, this transparent, technologically enhanced, 21st Century conference enabled all voices to be raised simultaneously while also being individually heard.</p>
            <p>Delivered collectively in as many as 20 languages, by 120 participants over the course of the event, the 11,200 individual responses filmed were all published the Internet within three days, under a 'Copyleft' license, at droppingknowledge.org. More than 1,000 hours of footage was ultimately recorded at perhaps the most comprehensively visually documented one-day gathering ever convened.</p>

        <h3>THE PROJECT</h3>

            <p>A vivid celebration of the symbolic power of cultural diversity and creative free expression, the Table of Free Voices marked the three-year culmination of the not-for-profit social media project, <a style="color:white;font-weight:bold" href="http://www.droppingknowledge.org" target="_blank">dropping knowledge</a>. Founded in the summer of 2003 by filmmaker Ralf Schmerberg, artist and designer Cindy Gantz and philanthropist-activist Jackie Northway-Wallace, dropping knowledge combined Gantz and Northway-Wallace's ideas for an interactive web-platform based around people's questions with Schmerberg's vision of a one-day meeting in which wise people could freely share their knowledge with the world.</p>
            <p>Based initially in Berlin and San Francisco, after two years of fundraising, administrative groundwork and research into possible Table participants, in September 2005 dropping knowledge announced a global call for questions relating to themes of social and conscious, individual and societal, change. Over the following year, tens of thousands of questions were submitted to the project's website by a global community of questioners. Hundreds of these were showcased in questions-based media created by the project's in-house team of editors, designers and visual researchers. Filmmakers traveled internationally for dropping knowledge, actively seeking questions to ensure an authentically global sample was dynamically visually represented online. At the climax of this 'Ask Yourself' campaign, a select 100 of the top 1,000 user-voted questions were chosen by the project's organizers and consultants to be asked at the Table of Free Voices.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, invitations had gone out to over 100 special individuals, all of whom were bold, brilliant, concerned or plain crazy enough to confirm their participation in an unprecedented experiment. Each had been approached on account of their life's work having had some creative, humanistic cultural impact. Each agreed to share their knowledge in response to people's questions &mdash; to reveal their passion, conviction, wisdom and vulnerability &mdash; on camera for one day.</p>

            <p>Officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the largest round table ever made, the Table of Free Voices measured 38 meters in diameter and over 119 in circumference. Within and around it in the week leading up to the event, dropping knowledge's full and part-time staff expanded to encompass over 100 volunteers, come to Berlin to share in the project's open spirit of democratic inquiry and people-powered, cross-cultural exchange.</p>
            <p>Financed primarily by thousands of online micro-donations, the gathering also received financial and advisory support from corporations, foundations, cultural institutions and non-governmental organizations. The United Nations Development Programme opened its contact book; the then Vice-Chancellor of Germany became the event's patron; future Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus saluted dropping knowledge as "a great initiative at the right time"; and the gathering received a personal blessing from Bishop Joseph Zen Ze-kiun of Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>Though neither the participants sitting at the Table of Free Voices, nor those working behind the scenes to realize its success, really had a good idea beforehand of what would actually transpire on the day itself, the gathering was in the end favored by a profound atmosphere of communal inspiration (and aspiration), mutual encouragement (and empowerment) and, thankfully, decent weather. One member of the public, stood with the crowd of curious bystanders congregating beyond the Table's perimeter, seemed to speak for many when he described the experience as "an art performance of electrifying energy... I can't hear what the participants are saying and my back hurts, but I just can't leave. I am going to stand here all through this thing. This is so powerful... It really gets you."</p>

        <h3>IN BEBELPLATZ</h3>

            <p>Amid the paving-stones of Berlin's Bebelplatz, there is a single glass pane, a window onto a blank white room, empty but for empty white bookshelves. The creation of sculptor Micha Ulman, this subsurface exhibit is a permanent memorial marking the spot where, on May 10, 1933, a bonfire was set ablaze.</p>
            <p>That evening, in a speech broadcast live to the nation by radio from the square in central Berlin then called the Opernplatz, the Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda proclaimed the destruction by fire of "Un-German" writings "a strong, great and symbolic deed." Over 25,000 books were burned that night in ceremonial gatherings across Nazi Germany. Among those cast to the flames was Heinrich Heine's play <i>Almansor</i>, in which it's written: <i>Das war ein Vorspiel, nur, dort wo man BÃ¼cher verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am Ende Menschen</i>. ('This was just a prelude, where they burn books, in the end they also burn people.')</p>
            <p>Where once these words were ritually incinerated, today, they are engraved in stone. Throughout the day of the Table of Free Voices, the gathering's focal center was this window onto empty silence, as the air above it reverberated with the collective hum of uncensored voices raised freely.</p>

        <h3>THE PRODUCTION</h3>

            <p>Long before he made a film, Ralf Schmerberg was thinking about a meeting at which people could share the wisdom of their understanding, one that could be filmed to connect others with their words. This intention &mdash; to use cinema to re-vivify the oral tradition in which he'd found meaning when young &mdash; stayed with Schmerberg, from around the day he heard J. Krishnamurti speak until one day years later in Bebelplatz when the vision was real.</p>
            <p>PROBLEMA is that gathering, lovingly rendered as imaginative, art cinema to be projected on the screen of the mind. Distilled from over 1,000 hours of footage, shaped out of individual monologue into rhythmic, multilingual 'multilogue', the panoply of perspectives recorded at the Table of Free Voices would eventually be overlayered with pictures in a process styled by Schmerberg 'editing into the subconscious'. Embedded with over 1,200 <a href="/visuality" style="color:white;font-weight:bold;">visual artefacts</a>, PROBLEMA transports the words spoken in Bebelplatz into the larger world, amplifying their resonance by combining them with film, art and photography from humanity's collective cultural memory.</p>
            <p>Dependent at every stage of its production on harnessing the democratizing potential of information technologies, PROBLEMA exists thanks to the generous contributions of many who influenced its creation: from those who gave permission to feature their footage and artwork, to those who volunteered their time and labor, to those who raised a question or made a micro-donation, to the participants who gave of their hearts and minds freely around the Table of Free Voices. In this sense, PROBLEMA is an authentically not-for-profit film, offered to audiences in the same spirit of giving that endlessly informed its realization.</p>
